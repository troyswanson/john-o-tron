# John-o-Tron 9000

No Johns

## Setup

The best way to work on this project is by [remixing](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/remix/john-o-tron) it on Glitch. There aren't any databases to manage or special backend services to run.

If you want to run it on your own computer, that's pretty easy too. You just need node 8.x already installed.

1. Get the code (clone from GitHub or download from Glitch)
2. Run `npm install` to install Express
3. Run `npm start` to start the server
4. The server is listening at [127.0.0.1:3000](http://127.0.0.1:3000)

## Shoutouts

The John-o-Tron was *not* my idea. The original concept for this project came from a [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/1wnmet/johnotron_9000_10/) created by [/u/niffyjiffy](http://www.reddit.com/user/niffyjiffy) in the [/r/smashbros](http://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/) subreddit on January 31, 2014. Since then, a bunch of people have tried their hand at their version of the John-o-Tron. Here's a list of the ones that I could find:

* [Tarek](http://www.reddit.com/user/Taerk) built a cool interface at [http://taerk.net/files/john-o-tron-9k.html](http://taerk.net/files/john-o-tron-9k.html)
* [pstrmclr](http://www.reddit.com/user/pstrmclr) made a JSFiddle over at [http://jsfiddle.net/rj4D9/](http://jsfiddle.net/rj4D9/)
* [SKELETORQUEMADA](http://www.reddit.com/user/SKELETORQUEMADA) just dropped some code for folks in this [comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/1wnmet/johnotron_9000_10/cf484j4)
* [csssuf](http://www.reddit.com/user/csssuf) went the extra mile and wrote an API at [http://csssuf.net/johnotron](http://csssuf.net/johnotron)
